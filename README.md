# Stock-market-analysis-and-prediction-using-social-media-network-data
This is our second year group project.
In this project over intention was to check the connectivity between sentiments of social media network data and the stock prices.
We used tweets about five major companies as social media network data and analyzed the correlation between tweets sentiment and the stock prices.
We used various deep learning and machine learning techniques for prediction of the future stock values using social media data and analyzed accuracies of different models.
All the data is stored in csv files that are existing on kaggle.com
